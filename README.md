# Student Performance Analysis

This repository contains a Python script that analyzes student performance data. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to answer several questions about student grades and factors affecting their academic success.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Student Performance Data Set obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: [Student Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance).

### Data Source

- **URL:** `https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00320/student.zip`
- **File Used:** `student-mat.csv`

### Description

The dataset contains information on students' performance in mathematics, along with various demographic and social factors. The primary target variable is `G3`, the final grade.

---

## Features of the Code

### 1. **Importing Libraries**

The code uses the following Python libraries:
- `pandas` for data handling
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization

---

### 2. **Data Loading**
The script:
- Downloads the dataset from the UCI repository
- Extracts the `.zip` file
- Loads the data into a Pandas DataFrame

---

### 3. **Data Exploration**
Initial exploration includes:
- Displaying the first few rows of the dataset
- Inspecting data types and identifying missing values
- Checking for duplicates and removing them

---

### 4. **Data Analysis**
Key questions answered in the analysis:
1. **What is the average final grade (`G3`) in math?**
   - The mean score is calculated.
2. **How many students scored above 15 in their final grade (`G3`)?**
   - Students scoring above 15 are counted.
3. **Is there a correlation between study time and final grade?**
   - The correlation coefficient is calculated.
4. **Which gender has a higher average final grade?**
   - The data is grouped by gender, and the mean grade is computed.

---

### 5. **Data Visualization**
Visualizations include:
1. **Histogram of Final Grades (`G3`):**
   - Displays the distribution of grades.
2. **Scatter Plot of Study Time vs. Final Grade:**
   - Explores the relationship between study time and grades, differentiated by gender.
3. **Bar Chart of Average Grades by Gender:**
   - Compares the average grades of male and female students.

## How to Run the Code

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Install Python (>=3.7).
   - Install required libraries using pip:  
     ```
     pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
     ```

2. **Run the Script:**
   Execute the script in any Python environment, such as Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, or the command line.

3. **Outputs:**
   - Key statistics printed to the console.
   - Visualizations displayed in separate windows.

---

## Example Outputs

- **Average Math Score (G3):** 10.42
- **Number of Students Scoring Above 15:** 48
- **Correlation between Study Time and Final Grade:** 0.10
- **Average Final Grade by Gender:**
  ```
  sex
  F    10.84
  M    10.24
  Name: G3, dtype: float64
  ```
